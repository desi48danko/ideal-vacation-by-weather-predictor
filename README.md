## About What's the Weather Like

`What's the Weather Like` is a Python data analytics challenge consisting of two parts:
1) `WeatherPy` pulls (Open Weather API, Google Geocode API), filters, and graphs world weather data to discover underlying trends with latitude vs. weather.
2) `VacationPy` filters for cities based on predefined "ideal" weather conditions, visualizes a heatmap using GMaps, and queries and plots the nearest hotels to said cities.
